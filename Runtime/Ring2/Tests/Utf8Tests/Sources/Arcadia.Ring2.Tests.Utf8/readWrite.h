/// Let x := [x[1], ..., x[n]] be a sequence such that each x[i] is an UTF-8 Byte sequence.
/// This test then performs for each x[i] the followin test:
/// - create a Byte buffer holding x[i]
/// - create an empty Byte buffer (target)
/// - read its unicode code points using Utf8ByteBufferReader from source
/// - write each unicode code point into target using Utf8ByteBufferWriter
/// - compare the contents of both Byte buffers
/// - success if their contents are equal
/// - failure otherwise
