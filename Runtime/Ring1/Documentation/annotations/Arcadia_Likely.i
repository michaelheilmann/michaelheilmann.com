  <p>
  For example, given typical programs, it is likely that <code>malloc</code> for a small size of memory is very likely to succeed.
  Hence, in the following code snipped, we tell tell the compiler that the test for success of a call to <code>malloc</code> is likely to to evaluate to logically true and
  the code in branch <code>(A)</code> is likely to  be executed whilst consequently the code in branch <code>(X)</code> is not likely to be execute.
  </p>
  <p><code>
  void* p = malloc(sizeof(char));<br>
  if (Arcadia_Likely(p)) {<br>
    /* (A) Foaming with joy, continue execution. */<br>
  } else {<br>
    /* (X) In the heart with pain, abort execution. */<br>
  }
  </code></p>
