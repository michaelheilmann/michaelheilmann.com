/// @brief
/// Let x := [x1, ..., xn] be a sequence of pairs such that x[i] is a pair (a_i, b_i) with a_i being a valid UTF-8 Byte sequence and b_i being a sequence of
/// Unicode code points corresponding to a_i.
/// This test then performs for each x[i] the followin test:
/// - store x[i].a in a Byte buffer
/// - decode the Byte buffer into a sequence of Unicode code points using an UTF-8 Byte buffer reader
/// - compare the decoded sequence to b[i] 
/// - success if they are equal
/// - failure otherwise
