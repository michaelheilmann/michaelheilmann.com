  <h1>Data Lifecycle Management</h1>
  <p>
  An organization manages its data through the data lifecycle. This document describes a possible data Lifecycle
  model.</p>
  <p>
  This document is based on <a href="#source-1">[1]</a> and deviates from [1] for the purpose of brevity, clarity, and generality.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Data Lifecycle Phases</h2>
  <p>
  The phases of the data lifecycle considered by this document are <em>Identify</em>, <em>Use</em>, <em>Maintain</em>, and <em>Dispose</em>.
  Not all data lifecycle phases occur for every datum.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Identify</b>:
      The organization identifies datums.
    </li>
    <li><b>Use</b>:
      The organization accesses, views, shares, and modifies datums.
      New datums may be created by aggregation or disaggregration of existing datums.
      Datums may also be repurposed.
    </li>
    <li><b>Maintain</b>:
      The organization preserves datums over time.
      This may include converting datums to different formats or representations as technologies change so it will continue to be usable.
    </li>
    <li><b>Dispose</b>:
      The organization disposes a datum at the end of its data lifeccle.
      The datum that is no longer needed or is required to be disposed is destroyed or otherwise made unavailable to unauthorized parties.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured Data</h2>
  <p><em>Structured data</em> has a known model that determine access and interpretation of the data.
  The opposite is <em>unstructured data</em> which has no known model associated that determines access or interpretation of the data.
  Between unstructured and structured data resides <em>semi-structured data</em> which has a known model associated which allows a certain
  degree of access and interpretation - however, the model associated that allows full access or interpretation is not known.</p>
